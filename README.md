# objdumper-extension README

Quick extension that provides an objdump view since I couldn't find one on the extension (or I suck at searching)

## Features

- It shows an objdump of a file that you right-click in the explorer.
- uhhhhhhhhhhh

## Requirements

- Extension looks for `objdump` located at `/usr/bin/objdump`
